## Narrative

This repository shows the complete narrative of the development process, from more-or-less conception of the idea to the point where it was ready to be published. The notebooks serve as "chapters" in my virtual lab notebook in an overly honest scientific publishing approach. Everything is here. The best existing documentation are the slide decks themselve, which are jupyter notebooks that start with "slides_".

The python files themselves will replicate the results, but this repo contains:

- Jupyter notebooks
- Python libraries
- Input datasets
- Manuscript source
- Slide decks
- Figures


## Usage

This is a prototype demonstration code. It doesn't really have all of the needed features of a reservoir simulations. For usage of the final simulator, look at the Section5 notebooks.
