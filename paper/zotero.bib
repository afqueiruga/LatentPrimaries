	abstract = {A central problem in modeling, namely that of learning an algebraic model from data obtained from simulations or experiments is addressed. A methodology that uses a small number of simulations or experiments to learn models that are as accurate and as simple as possible is proposed. The approach begins by building a low-complexity surrogate model. The model is built using a best subset technique that leverages an integer programming formulation to allow for the efficient consideration of a large number of possible functional components in the model. The model is then improved systematically through the use of derivative-free optimization solvers to adaptively sample new simulation or experimental points. Automated learning of algebraic models for optimization ({ALAMO}), the computational implementation of the proposed methodology, along with examples and extensive computational comparisons between {ALAMO} and a variety of machine learning techniques, including Latin hypercube sampling, simple least-squares regression, and the lasso is described.

	abstract = {{ALAMO} is a computational methodology for learning algebraic functions from data. Given a data set, the approach begins by building a low-complexity, linear model composed of explicit non-linear transformations of the independent variables. Linear combinations of these non-linear transformations allow a linear model to better approximate complex behavior observed in real processes. The model is refined, as additional data are obtained in an adaptive fashion through error maximization sampling using derivative-free optimization. Models built using {ALAMO} can enforce constraints on the response variables to incorporate first-principles knowledge. The ability of {ALAMO} to generate simple and accurate models for a number of reaction problems is demonstrated. The error maximization sampling is compared with Latin hypercube designs to demonstrate its sampling efficiency. {ALAMO}'s constrained regression methodology is used to further refine concentration models, resulting in models that perform better on validation data and satisfy upper and lower bounds placed on model outputs.},

	abstract = {We address a central theme of empirical model building: the incorporation of first-principles information in a data-driven model-building process. By enabling modelers to leverage all available information, regression models can be constructed using measured data along with theory-driven knowledge of response variable bounds, thermodynamic limitations, boundary conditions, and other aspects of system knowledge. We expand the inclusion of regression constraints beyond intra-parameter relationships to relationships between combinations of predictors and response variables. Since the functional form of these constraints is more intuitive, they can be used to reveal hidden relationships between regression parameters that are not directly available to the modeler. First, we describe classes of a priori modeling constraints. Next, we propose a semi-infinite programming approach for the incorporation of these novel constraints. Finally, we detail several application areas and provide extensive computational results.},
